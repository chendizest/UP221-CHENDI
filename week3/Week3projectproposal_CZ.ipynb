    "\"Wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, are a growing planning and policy challenge worldwide, particularly in California. In this study, we focused on three primary local planning mechanisms: the General Plan (GP), Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP), and Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), to examine the effectiveness of local mitigation efforts in California's 58 counties. Using content analysis protocols, the study evaluates county-level GPs, HMPs, and CWPPs to assess wildfire management performance and identify common gaps in wildfire management measures across counties. Our evaluation also aligns with the Social Vulnerability Index of 58 CA counties to investigate the relationship between wildfire management performance and each county's socio-economic status. The results provide insights into the effectiveness and shortcomings of current wildfire resilience measures in California's counties. We conclude with implications for planning guidelines and policy-making, aiming to strengthen future wildfire resilience strategies.\""

This study takes California, a U.S. state with severe and growing wildfire concerns, as a case study to examine what is lacking in wildfire management and planning effectiveness. It not only examines wildfire management evaluation and guide for California but also provides grounded and generalizable wildfire management gaps in policy-making and planning guidelines for areas with higher wildfire hazard risks. More importantly, the study examines if each county’s socio-economic status impacts wildfire planning effectiveness.\""
